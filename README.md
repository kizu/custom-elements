# My Custom Elements

This is a collection of my experimental custom elements.

I have no idea what I’m doing, and I am publishing them just for my personal usage. If you find them useful — great, but don’t expect any support.

Nothing is optimal here, all is work in progress, stuff will be rewritten and deprecated. Do not rely on anything.
